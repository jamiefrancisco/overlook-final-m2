# Overlook

## Project Overview
This was the final solo project for Mod 2 at Turing. We were asked to build a hotel management tool/booking site. A user is able to log in, view  upcoming and past bookings, see their total spend, and make additional bookings based on room type and date.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS, JS, Mocha/Chai, and Fetch API

## Challenges/Wins
One of my biggest challenges (and wins) was figuring out how to not display rooms that were already booked to the user. The final step to overcoming this challenge was reformatting the date output from the HTML date picker into the same format that my booking data had (going from YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY/MM/DD).
